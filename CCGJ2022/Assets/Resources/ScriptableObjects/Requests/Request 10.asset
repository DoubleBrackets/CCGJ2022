  initialRequestText: "To the respected potions merchant,\r\n\r\nI\u2019d not tell
    you my name, for I work in the risky business of playing odds, and odds are a
    deadly thing indeed. However, do know that I pay well, and that I would very
    much like your service for an ample reward.\r\nI will specify my needs below.
    You need not know where to send your potion to, for the owl is clever enough
    to know the way, and is quite a good secret keeper at that!\r\n\r\nI must have
    something that will bring me great riches in my ventures. Luck, fortune, all
    flavors that shall bring me superior odds, I must have. But do not get fixated
    on this alone! As I have mentioned above, my business is a risky one, filled
    with unsavory fellows. Fellows who would not hesitate to put me away \u2018neath
    the ground.\r\n\r\nAs such, I also require that you find a way to protect me,
    shield me against the misfortune of man. My inherent alertness does go a long
    way, but aided with your superior skills, I will truly make fortunes!\r\n\r\nFinest
    regards,\r\nYour local businessman\r\n"

      It is with displeasure that I
      must tell you that your potion was of little to no effect.

      Your attempt
      is appreciated, but I pray that you improve your skills so that I may find
      your future potions more helpful than the present ones.
