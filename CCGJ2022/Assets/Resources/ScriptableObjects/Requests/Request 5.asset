  initialRequestText: "Sir potion seller,\r\n\r\nI hope this correspondence finds
    you well, and filled with physical and mental strength, for my request of you,
    I fear, will require quite the exertion.\r\n\r\nYou may have heard of elderly
    Olga, recently widowed and currently the topic of whispers throughout time. This,
    admittedly, is I, but I beseech you to cast aside your pity and channel your
    energy into something else this eve, for I am pursued by something that brings
    great unrest to my old bones.\r\n\r\nIn the passing of my late husband, I have
    begun to feel as if his presence has not yet left the halls and stairways of
    our old abode.  This is not, I believe, the typical widower's grief. It is something
    unnatural, an instability that echoes my footsteps. It has made me a restless,
    wretched creature, and it is surely this increased wretchedness that has led
    to such pitiful looks from my neighbors and strangers alike. But it is not the
    absence, so much as the maddening lingering of my husband, that brings this about.
    \r\n\r\nI fear my pulse is permanently erratic, my mind ineffably frazzled by
    this lingering, ghosting presence. So I call upon you, potion seller, to bring
    this old woman to some sense of tranquility of mind once more.\r\n"

    responseText: "\tTreasured potion seller, how may I in the limitations of mere
      words express my gratefulness towards you and your work? For the potion you
      sent my way has cleansed me completely of the lingering legacy of my husband
      and all the furious anxiety that had come with it. Once more I find myself
      in comfortable, contented peace, with only the typical widows sorrow in my
      heart. This return of normalcy relieves me greatly and it is all, I know, thanks
      to your noble work and efforts, my sweet, sweet potions master! \r\n\r\n-Olga\r\n"

      you for your valiant attempt to quell the unease that had settled so thoroughly
      in my life. Indeed it has in a sense been uprooted, I no longer feel that lingering
      presence behind me in the halls of my home, and yet for some purpose the anxiety
      of it has not left my heart. Perhaps this is a condition beyond the abilities
      of your potions,  though I hate to imply so, for you have indeed done good
      by this old woman.  Regardless, you deserve the thanks I now extend toward
      you.\r\n\r\n-Olga\r\n"
