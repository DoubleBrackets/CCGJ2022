  initialRequestText: "Sir potion seller,\r\n\r\nI hope this correspondence finds
    you well, and filled with physical and mental strength, for my request of you,
    I fear, will require quite the exertion.\r\n\r\nYou may have heard of elderly
    Olga, recently widowed and currently the topic of whispers throughout time. This,
    admittedly, is I, but I beseech you to cast aside your pity and channel your
    energy into something else this eve, for I am pursued by something that brings
    great unrest to my old bones.\r\n\r\nIn the passing of my late husband, I have
    begun to feel as if his presence has not yet left the halls and stairways of
    our old abode.  This is not, I believe, the typical widower's grief. It is something
    unnatural, an instability that echoes my footsteps. It has made me a restless,
    wretched creature, and it is surely this increased wretchedness that has led
    to such pitiful looks from my neighbors and strangers alike. But it is not the
    absence, so much as the maddening lingering of my husband, that brings this about.
    \r\n\r\nI fear my pulse is permanently erratic, my mind ineffably frazzled by
    this lingering, ghosting presence. So I call upon you, potion seller, to bring
    this old woman to some sense of tranquility of mind once more.\r\n"

      Your potion was most excellent,
      and suited to my needs perfectly!  I would consider it nothing short of a miracle.
      I thank you for your irreplaceable service, and will remain eternally grateful!

      It is with displeasure that I
      must tell you that your potion was of little to no effect.

      Your attempt
      is appreciated, but I pray that you improve your skills so that I may find
      your future potions more helpful than the present ones.
