  initialRequestText: "Hello Potion Seller,\r\n\r\nI am a knight, going into battle,
    and I require your strongest potions. I have been told by other sellers that
    their potions are too strong for me. Yet, again, I being a knight heading into
    battle I find myself in need of your strongest potions. \r\n\r\nNevermind that
    I am a man, even a potion strong enough to enrapture a beast would fit. Should
    it kill me, so be it, for I am a Knight going into battle and I will say but
    once more that I am in need of your strongest potions.\r\n"

    responseText: "To the masterful potion seller,\r\n\r\nI am beyond satisfied with
      the quality and potency of your potion. While I write this with my toes, having
      torn off my limbs with the sheer strength of which my greatsword was swung,
      I can assure you that the dastardly foe receiving the heavenly blow came out
      far worse. The potion was truly too strong, but too strong for me? Nay, I say,
      but rather, the perfect strength! \r\n\r\nFret not, for as soon as I am able
      to swing my blade once through the faculties of my feet, I will be sure to
      return for your potions once more!\r\n"

    responseText: "To the cowardly potion seller,\r\n\r\nHow have you deceived such
      an honest knight so? I asked for nothing but your strongest of potions, but
      you, in lieu of what I so pleaded for, gave me nothing but pasty water! The
      strength of that potion is naught to even defeat a fly, much less aid me in
      my righteous battles against the terrible foes that lie in wait! Did you not
      stop to think, dear potion master, that your deception could spill my life-blood
      across the hallowed ground? For when a knight goes into battle, they must prepare
      nothing but the greatest of strengths, and anything else should be certain
      doom!  \r\n\r\nWhile I bested my foe with nothing but my own mortal power,
      I may not be as fortunate next time! I beseech you, do not perform such a foolish
      mistake again! I must implore you to understand that when I ask for your strongest
      potions, I speak not in riddles, but in the wholehearted truth!\r\n"
