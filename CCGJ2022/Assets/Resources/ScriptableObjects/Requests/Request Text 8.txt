To the esteemed potions merchant,

I hope that you remember our correspondence,  as I was the printer who had previously serviced you when you sought to advertise your potion business through use of printed posters. However, we seem to have exchanged positions this time, as it is now I who is seeking your abilities.

You know me to be a dedicated worker, and I oft stay overnight at my shop, choosing to sleep on the wooden workbench to squeeze in the tiniest amounts of additional work. Print machines are finicky, and I would loath to leave a damaged one overnight on its own. However, I find that sleeping in the freezing workshop is far from ideal, and would like to find a solution from you. 

I seek a potion that will lull me to sleep with waves of drowsiness, while also granting me the warmth of the finest wood stove. With those two effects, I should be calm in the freezing storm of night and will find no trouble in slumbering the night away with my iron-print beauties.  

Quite sincerely, Derrick.

Potions master,

It is with displeasure that I must tell you that your potion was of little to no effect.
Your attempt is appreciated, but I pray that you improve your skills so that I may find your future potions more helpful than the present ones.
