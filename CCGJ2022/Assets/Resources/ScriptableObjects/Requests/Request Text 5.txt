Sir potion seller,

I hope this correspondence finds you well, and filled with physical and mental strength, for my request of you, I fear, will require quite the exertion.

You may have heard of elderly Olga, recently widowed and currently the topic of whispers throughout time. This, admittedly, is I, but I beseech you to cast aside your pity and channel your energy into something else this eve, for I am pursued by something that brings great unrest to my old bones.

In the passing of my late husband, I have begun to feel as if his presence has not yet left the halls and stairways of our old abode.  This is not, I believe, the typical widower's grief. It is something unnatural, an instability that echoes my footsteps. It has made me a restless, wretched creature, and it is surely this increased wretchedness that has led to such pitiful looks from my neighbors and strangers alike. But it is not the absence, so much as the maddening lingering of my husband, that brings this about. 

I fear my pulse is permanently erratic, my mind ineffably frazzled by this lingering, ghosting presence. So I call upon you, potion seller, to bring this old woman to some sense of tranquility of mind once more.

	Treasured potion seller, how may I in the limitations of mere words express my gratefulness towards you and your work? For the potion you sent my way has cleansed me completely of the lingering legacy of my husband and all the furious anxiety that had come with it. Once more I find myself in comfortable, contented peace, with only the typical widows sorrow in my heart. This return of normalcy relieves me greatly and it is all, I know, thanks to your noble work and efforts, my sweet, sweet potions master!

	Dear potion seller, I write to return a thanks of a kind to you for your valiant attempt to quell the unease that had settled so thoroughly in my life. Indeed it has in a sense been uprooted, I no longer feel that lingering presence behind me in the halls of my home, and yet for some purpose the anxiety of it has not left my heart. Perhaps this is a condition beyond the abilities of your potions,  though I hate to imply so, for you have indeed done good by this old woman.  Regardless, you deserve the thanks I now extend toward you.

	Potion seller! I have no doubt, for you are indeed one of honor, that you have no purposefully deceived me with the concoction you sent my way, and yet its utter ineffectiveness and cleansing my life of either the lingering ghost of my former husband nor the great and overwhelming anxiety in my breast makes it feel as such! It mourns me that your efforts were so ineffective, for now I fear I am destined to be lost in this sea of unease and fear! It shall be the end of me.

-Olga
