Sir potion seller,

I hope this correspondence finds you well, and filled with physical and mental strength, for my request of you, I fear, will require quite the exertion.

You may have heard of elderly Olga, recently widowed and currently the topic of whispers throughout time. This, admittedly, is I, but I beseech you to cast aside your pity and channel your energy into something else this eve, for I am pursued by something that brings great unrest to my old bones.

In the passing of my late husband, I have begun to feel as if his presence has not yet left the halls and stairways of our old abode.  This is not, I believe, the typical widower's grief. It is something unnatural, an instability that echoes my footsteps. It has made me a restless, wretched creature, and it is surely this increased wretchedness that has led to such pitiful looks from my neighbors and strangers alike. But it is not the absence, so much as the maddening lingering of my husband, that brings this about. 

I fear my pulse is permanently erratic, my mind ineffably frazzled by this lingering, ghosting presence. So I call upon you, potion seller, to bring this old woman to some sense of tranquility of mind once more.

Potions master,

It is with displeasure that I must tell you that your potion was of little to no effect.
Your attempt is appreciated, but I pray that you improve your skills so that I may find your future potions more helpful than the present ones.

-Olga
