  initialRequestText: "Hello good potion seller,\r\n\r\nSurely you must recognize
    me, Artur, by now, not so much through my personage but through this illness
    of mine you have so dutifully been treating the last few years. \r\n\r\nOnce
    more, I write calling upon your skills to help recover my strength, with a bit
    of fresh news. I am moving away. My kindly Aunt, who lives in the far countryside,
    has volunteered to house me at her estate. With hopes that the fresh country
    air will do my crippled lungs some good, after, of course, a great bout of hesitation,
    my parents have solemnly agreed to the move.\r\n\r\nSo long has it been that
    I\u2019ve had to rely on your potions, good seller, and while I am grateful for
    their ability to purify my breaths for but a while, I do hope that this coming
    change of life will help me conquer the accursed affliction for good.\r\n\r\nAnd
    so it is with equal amounts bitter and sweet that I repose to you my last request
    for a draught of my reprieve, dear potion seller, and bid you a thousand thanks
    and pardons.\r\n"

      estate, with the most wonderful of news. Your last potion in collaboration
      with this exquisite wild air has left me feeling healthier and lighter than
      ever before. No longer do my lungs ache with the exercise of walking about
      the world. I should never be able to thank you enough for all you have done,
      and this glorious new health you have helped bestow upon me! Praise you, my
      dear potion seller, praise you !\r\n"
