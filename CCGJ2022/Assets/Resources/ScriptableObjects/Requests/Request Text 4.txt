Sweet potion seller,

I reach for your tender helping hand with a matter of utmost, burning urgency. I, Jeremia, am one you may have seen before, running about the docks in this languid little town, sweat on my brow and the peculiar bounce of walk I have made my own over the years. Yes, you may have seen me before, but now, I am so ill that I would surely be unrecognizable to even those who love me with profound intimacy.

My skin now glows with the dew of a heat unknown even to the devil in his sweltering dwelling. The very furnace of hell seems to have nestled itself into my core, and is intent on burning me from the inside out, body and soul holistically.

And of course, because the world is generally cruel but to me even crueler, this affliction has come over me at the worst possible moment: for in two days time, I have a long awaited rendezvous with the most handsome man who has long been an object of my affections. Yet I fear in my current condition, the heat of my skin would burn him, and turn him away from me, and this coming meeting would meet a pitiful end unfit to the genuine nature and fervency of my feelings.

To be fit for this long awaited moment which holds my youthful hope in its grasp, I ask for your expertise.

	Honored potion seller! Hero of my life and love, I write to you with immense gratitude, for your potion has quelled the unnatural heat inside me and fostered a new one in the form of youthful, passionate love. Freshly renewed by the concoction you sent me, I flew to see the object of my affections with overwhelming health and hope of heart, and was met with a most favorable result indeed.  A million thanks to you, reputable potion seller, from both me and my new pure love!

	Oh potion seller, I write to you equal portions contented and restless, for while the heat burning my flesh is gone, my love for whom I wished to purify myself of this ailment for has been unresponsive to my earnest calls. Indeed it seems in quelling one heat the potion quelled another, for the fit of passion in both me and that whom I had come to be so fond for seems to have cooled just as well. For this I am much grieved, and while I would not wish for the heat of my skin to be returned at any cost, I nevertheless yearn for that lovely passion of attraction to return and bear its fruits to me.

	Potion seller, should I know any better, I would think you wished for my ultimate spiritual and physical demise! The furnace within me was anything but quelled by your concoction, and as a result, the prospect of budding love which had been so near to my gasp has been extinguished! This dual agony tortures me and I entreat you to please, potion seller, have mercy, and be truthful when I ask you if I shall ever overcome this foulness in my veins or if I am doomed to perish, sullied and alone.
