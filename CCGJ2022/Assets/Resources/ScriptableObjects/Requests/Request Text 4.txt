Sweet potion seller,

I reach for your tender helping hand with a matter of utmost, burning urgency. I, Jeremia, am one you may have seen before, running about the docks in this languid little town, sweat on my brow and the peculiar bounce of walk I have made my own over the years. Yes, you may have seen me before, but now, I am so ill that I would surely be unrecognizable to even those who love me with profound intimacy.

My skin now glows with the dew of a heat unknown even to the devil in his sweltering dwelling. The very furnace of hell seems to have nestled itself into my core, and is intent on burning me from the inside out, body and soul holistically.

And of course, because the world is generally cruel but to me even crueler, this affliction has come over me at the worst possible moment: for in two days time, I have a long awaited rendezvous with the most handsome man who has long been an object of my affections. Yet I fear in my current condition, the heat of my skin would burn him, and turn him away from me, and this coming meeting would meet a pitiful end unfit to the genuine nature and fervency of my feelings.

To be fit for this long awaited moment which holds my youthful hope in its grasp, I ask for your expertise.
