To the respected potions merchant,

I’d not tell you my name, for I work in the risky business of playing odds, and odds are a deadly thing indeed. However, do know that I pay well, and that I would very much like your service for an ample reward.
I will specify my needs below. You need not know where to send your potion to, for the owl is clever enough to know the way, and is quite a good secret keeper at that!

I must have something that will bring me great riches in my ventures. Luck, fortune, all flavors that shall bring me superior odds, I must have. But do not get fixated on this alone! As I have mentioned above, my business is a risky one, filled with unsavory fellows. Fellows who would not hesitate to put me away ‘neath the ground.

As such, I also require that you find a way to protect me, shield me against the misfortune of man. My inherent alertness does go a long way, but aided with your superior skills, I will truly make fortunes!

Finest regards,
Your local businessman

Potions master,

It is with displeasure that I must tell you that your potion was of little to no effect.
Your attempt is appreciated, but I pray that you improve your skills so that I may find your future potions more helpful than the present ones.
