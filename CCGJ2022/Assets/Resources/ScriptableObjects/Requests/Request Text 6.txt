Esteemed potion master,

You would not disagree with me, I believe, when I say your work and its products constitute a form of elusive and entrancing artistry. An artist myself, I go by K. in the township, I have both a taste and an affinity for such things, and your products have enticed my mind for some while, although this is the first time I find myself in adequate need of one out of necessity rather than of aesthetic pursuits.

How ironic, indeed, then, that I should desire this necessary product to bring back the joy and potency of vision I once had with my own artistic and aesthetic endeavors. For recently the well inside me, which was once overflowing with movement and passion and drive now tortures and mocks me in its eternall dryness. Never before has this well of artistry in my soul burned out so thoroughly, and I fear that for once in my long, historic career, my own ambition alone will not be enough to revive its waters.

This void of vigor has indeed left the world around me a hollow shell of what I remember it to be when I was still overflowing with artistic confidence and my own vanity. Life seems to have dulled; my merits waned, and I fear my future as an artist, or rather, my future as a prosperous human being walking on this mortal earth, should be lost if this not be restored. 

So I plead you, dear, genius crafter of potions, to use your own art to once again inspire me to my own, for only then will my truth of life be restored.

Potions master,

It is with displeasure that I must tell you that your potion was of little to no effect.
Your attempt is appreciated, but I pray that you improve your skills so that I may find your future potions more helpful than the present ones.
