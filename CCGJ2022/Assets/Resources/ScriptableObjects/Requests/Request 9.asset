  initialRequestText: "I hope this letter finds you in good condition, as I have
    been frazzled of late and my mind scattered like the wind. Of course, this state
    of mind happens to be the very ailment I come to you for. I find myself employed
    as the night guard for a nearby storehouse, and as such, have the obligation
    to be the ever-vigilant eye against the darkness.\r\n\r\nHowever, one might say
    I am too vigilant, as I have found that I twitch and turn at every whisper of
    the wind, and my nerves are frayed even as the night is young.  But herein lies
    the dilemma - the night guardsman must not be too lax, lest they be rendered
    ineffective, but if they are as scattered far and apart as I, then they are just
    as useless! \r\n\r\nI ask you to provide some potion that will let me be a stable
    wall against the night, ever alert but calm in my manners. Should you find this
    paradoxical task up to your skills, I would be in your debt. Every night brings
    me closer to my wits end, and as such I pray that you have the means to assist
    me.\r\n\r\nAlways steadfast,\r\nJoann\r\n"

      Your potion was most excellent,
      and suited to my needs perfectly!  I would consider it nothing short of a miracle.
      I thank you for your irreplaceable service, and will remain eternally grateful!

      It is with displeasure that I
      must tell you that your potion was of little to no effect.

      Your attempt
      is appreciated, but I pray that you improve your skills so that I may find
      your future potions more helpful than the present ones.
