  initialRequestText: "Esteemed potion master,\r\n\r\nYou would not disagree with
    me, I believe, when I say your work and its products constitute a form of elusive
    and entrancing artistry. An artist myself, I go by K. in the township, I have
    both a taste and an affinity for such things, and your products have enticed
    my mind for some while, although this is the first time I find myself in adequate
    need of one out of necessity rather than of aesthetic pursuits.\r\n\r\nHow ironic,
    indeed, then, that I should desire this necessary product to bring back the joy
    and potency of vision I once had with my own artistic and aesthetic endeavors.
    For recently the well inside me, which was once overflowing with movement and
    passion and drive now tortures and mocks me in its eternall dryness. Never before
    has this well of artistry in my soul burned out so thoroughly, and I fear that
    for once in my long, historic career, my own ambition alone will not be enough
    to revive its waters.\r\n\r\nThis void of vigor has indeed left the world around
    me a hollow shell of what I remember it to be when I was still overflowing with
    artistic confidence and my own vanity. Life seems to have dulled; my merits waned,
    and I fear my future as an artist, or rather, my future as a prosperous human
    being walking on this mortal earth, should be lost if this not be restored. \r\n\r\nSo
    I plead you, dear, genius crafter of potions, to use your own art to once again
    inspire me to my own, for only then will my truth of life be restored.\r\n"
