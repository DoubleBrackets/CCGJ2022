  initialRequestText: "Hello good potion seller,\r\n\r\nSurely you must recognize
    me, Artur, by now, not so much through my personage but through this illness
    of mine you have so dutifully been treating the last few years. \r\n\r\nOnce
    more, I write calling upon your skills to help recover my strength, with a bit
    of fresh news. I am moving away. My kindly Aunt, who lives in the far countryside,
    has volunteered to house me at her estate. With hopes that the fresh country
    air will do my crippled lungs some good, after, of course, a great bout of hesitation,
    my parents have solemnly agreed to the move.\r\n\r\nSo long has it been that
    I\u2019ve had to rely on your potions, good seller, and while I am grateful for
    their ability to purify my breaths for but a while, I do hope that this coming
    change of life will help me conquer the accursed affliction for good.\r\n\r\nAnd
    so it is with equal amounts bitter and sweet that I repose to you my last request
    for a draught of my reprieve, dear potion seller, and bid you a thousand thanks
    and pardons.\r\n"
