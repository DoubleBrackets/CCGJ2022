Potion seller,

After some desperate consultations with those closest and dearest to me, I, Amalia, apprentice of the local Book Keep, have conceded to calling upon your talents for assistance. For I have been led to believe it is only you that can lessen the effects of this terrible curse that terrible man has laid upon me.

Recently, I have found my life's love. We met by chance, her being of the time engaged with a man of lesser caliber. Our love was fierce, immediate, and shook the very course of both our lives. As she left that pitiful man to revel in the mutual sense of completion we found in each other's arms, I felt the burning gaze of hatred upon me, for my love is very fair and desirable among all, and to lose her, I would liken to losing the very sun we each thrive upon.

Since I felt that molten gaze of contempt, I have been overrun by fatigue. My love tends to me, gently, caringly, so that my affections increase ten fold each day, but without the strength to stand and embrace her as I wish, I find myself going mad. Should I try, my head spins, and I sooner embrace the floor. And I, with the true intuition of a learned woman, know that it is that little, weasel of a man who curses my name for claiming my love from him that manifests this weakness in me.

Please esteemed potion seller, help me expel this curse and reclaim once more the vigor I need to spend the rest of my days with healthy, impassioned contentment with this new love.

	Sweet, sweet potion seller! I write to you with joyous, energized hands. Yes, this body of mine has finally reclaimed the vigorous passion of my yet glorious youth, and so I write with a strong, clear head and fiercely beating heart. The potion you so graciously made for me has given me new life, protection from that accursed man, so that I may fully enjoy the passion of my new lifes love. My darling sends her thanks to you as well, as her fondness for me resulted in my illness being as filled with turmoil for her as I.  A million, endless thanks to you, my sweet potion seller!

	Dear potion seller! I write to you now that your concoction has returned much of my strength to me. Still yet a numbness lingers in my mind and tips of my fingers, but what can you do in the face of such malice as the one being directed towards me? Regardless, my love keeps me enlightened, and I can now embrace her with purpose, although not with the same energy I know I once possessed.  My thanks reach out to you, potion seller, for the valiant attempt at squealing this fatigue.

	Oh potion seller, I write to you with faintness of heart and body. Yes, I regret to say this accursed dizziness prevails over me. Alas! Should that blasted man's cursed words be so powerful as to bring my spirit to so low a state, even with the help of your esteemed mind. Not even the sweetness and purity of my darling's love can protect me from such hatred. Think of me, potion seller, and if you are of the faith, perhaps even pray that I may not spend the rest of my life bedridden from this ailment.
