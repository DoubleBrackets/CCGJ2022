  initialRequestText: 'Potion Master,

    

    Being yourself one of an intellectual
    practice, of which I believe much schooling is required, you may be able to understand
    the woes and weariness of one studying law at our local institution.

    

    Sleep
    evades me, in every sense of the word. I try desperately to grasp the coattails
    of drowsiness, but pure exhaustion overwhelms me, fills my fingers with lead,
    and leaves me awake and wearier than before. My studies for so long demanded
    these long nights from my body, I had not realized that violated what my body
    demanded from me until sleep had already long disappeared from my sights.

    

    I
    wish to dream. Rest. Feel the sharpness of a mind freshly reset. Please, potion
    master, make this so possible. Not only my body but my soul has been seized with
    the anxiety of a mind perpetually awake. I seek reprieve above all else.
