  initialRequestText: "To the esteemed potions merchant,\r\n\r\nI hope that you remember
    our correspondence,  as I was the printer who had previously serviced you when
    you sought to advertise your potion business through use of printed posters.
    However, we seem to have exchanged positions this time, as it is now I who is
    seeking your abilities.\r\n\r\nYou know me to be a dedicated worker, and I oft
    stay overnight at my shop, choosing to sleep on the wooden workbench to squeeze
    in the tiniest amounts of additional work. Print machines are finicky, and I
    would loath to leave a damaged one overnight on its own. However, I find that
    sleeping in the freezing workshop is far from ideal, and would like to find a
    solution from you. \r\n\r\nI seek a potion that will lull me to sleep with waves
    of drowsiness, while also granting me the warmth of the finest wood stove. With
    those two effects, I should be calm in the freezing storm of night and will find
    no trouble in slumbering the night away with my iron-print beauties.  \r\n\r\nQuite
    sincerely, Derrick.\r\n"

      Your potion was most excellent,
      and suited to my needs perfectly!  I would consider it nothing short of a miracle.
      I thank you for your irreplaceable service, and will remain eternally grateful!

      It is with displeasure that I
      must tell you that your potion was of little to no effect.

      Your attempt
      is appreciated, but I pray that you improve your skills so that I may find
      your future potions more helpful than the present ones.
