Hello good potion seller,

Surely you must recognize me, Artur, by now, not so much through my personage but through this illness of mine you have so dutifully been treating the last few years. 

Once more, I write calling upon your skills to help recover my strength, with a bit of fresh news. I am moving away. My kindly Aunt, who lives in the far countryside, has volunteered to house me at her estate. With hopes that the fresh country air will do my crippled lungs some good, after, of course, a great bout of hesitation, my parents have solemnly agreed to the move.

So long has it been that Iâ€™ve had to rely on your potions, good seller, and while I am grateful for their ability to purify my breaths for but a while, I do hope that this coming change of life will help me conquer the accursed affliction for good.

And so it is with equal amounts bitter and sweet that I repose to you my last request for a draught of my reprieve, dear potion seller, and bid you a thousand thanks and pardons.
