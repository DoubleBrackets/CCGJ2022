Potion Master,

Being yourself one of an intellectual practice, of which I believe much schooling is required, you may be able to understand the woes and weariness of one studying law at our local institution.

Sleep evades me, in every sense of the word. I try desperately to grasp the coattails of drowsiness, but pure exhaustion overwhelms me, fills my fingers with lead, and leaves me awake and wearier than before. My studies for so long demanded these long nights from my body, I had not realized that violated what my body demanded from me until sleep had already long disappeared from my sights.

I wish to dream. Rest. Feel the sharpness of a mind freshly reset. Please, potion master, make this so possible. Not only my body but my soul has been seized with the anxiety of a mind perpetually awake. I seek reprieve above all else.

The potion was excellent.

The potion did not work.
