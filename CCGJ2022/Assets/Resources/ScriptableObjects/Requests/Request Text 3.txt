Potion Master,

Being yourself one of an intellectual practice, of which I believe much schooling is required, you may be able to understand the woes and weariness of one studying law at our local institution.

Sleep evades me, in every sense of the word. I try desperately to grasp the coattails of drowsiness, but pure exhaustion overwhelms me, fills my fingers with lead, and leaves me awake and wearier than before. My studies for so long demanded these long nights from my body, I had not realized that violated what my body demanded from me until sleep had already long disappeared from my sights.

I wish to dream. Rest. Feel the sharpness of a mind freshly reset. Please, potion master, make this so possible. Not only my body but my soul has been seized with the anxiety of a mind perpetually awake. I seek reprieve above all else.

	Potion seller! My good, good potion seller, I apologize for not having sent word of my condition sooner, but I have been too intoxicated by my recent restfulness. For almost days I lay under a much needed slumber as a result of your exalted potion, and my entire being sags with the relief of it.  My studies have prospered from having been worked upon by an unclouded mind, and my soul soars knowing that when I lay down, sleep can now come swiftly and naturally to me. A thousand thanks to you, my good potion seller. Once I expire from the institute with the fruits of my, and now your own, labors, should you ever need legal assistance I shall not hesitate to drop any prior engagements to return this debt I now owe you.

Potions master,

It is with displeasure that I must tell you that your potion was of little to no effect.
Your attempt is appreciated, but I pray that you improve your skills so that I may find your future potions more helpful than the present ones.
