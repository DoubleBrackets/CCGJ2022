  initialRequestText: 'Potion seller,

    

    After some desperate consultations
    with those closest and dearest to me, I, Amalia, apprentice of the local Book
    Keep, have conceded to calling upon your talents for assistance. For I have been
    led to believe it is only you that can lessen the effects of this terrible curse
    that terrible man has laid upon me.

    

    Recently, I have found my life''s
    love. We met by chance, her being of the time engaged with a man of lesser caliber.
    Our love was fierce, immediate, and shook the very course of both our lives.
    As she left that pitiful man to revel in the mutual sense of completion we found
    in each other''s arms, I felt the burning gaze of hatred upon me, for my love
    is very fair and desirable among all, and to lose her, I would liken to losing
    the very sun we each thrive upon.

    

    Since I felt that molten gaze
    of contempt, I have been overrun by fatigue. My love tends to me, gently, caringly,
    so that my affections increase ten fold each day, but without the strength to
    stand and embrace her as I wish, I find myself going mad. Should I try, my head
    spins, and I sooner embrace the floor. And I, with the true intuition of a learned
    woman, know that it is that little, weasel of a man who curses my name for claiming
    my love from him that manifests this weakness in me.

    

    Please esteemed
    potion seller, help me expel this curse and reclaim once more the vigor I need
    to spend the rest of my days with healthy, impassioned contentment with this
    new love.
