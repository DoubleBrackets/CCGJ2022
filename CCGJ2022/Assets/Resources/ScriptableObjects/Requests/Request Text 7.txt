Hello Potion Seller,

I am a knight, going into battle, and I require your strongest potions. I have been told by other sellers that their potions are too strong for me. Yet, again, I being a knight heading into battle I find myself in need of your strongest potions. 

Nevermind that I am a man, even a potion strong enough to enrapture a beast would fit. Should it kill me, so be it, for I am a Knight going into battle and I will say but once more that I am in need of your strongest potions.

To the masterful potion seller,

I am beyond satisfied with the quality and potency of your potion. While I write this with my toes, having torn off my limbs with the sheer strength of which my greatsword was swung, I can assure you that the dastardly foe receiving the heavenly blow came out far worse. The potion was truly too strong, but too strong for me? Nay, I say, but rather, the perfect strength! 

Fret not, for as soon as I am able to swing my blade once through the faculties of my feet, I will be sure to return for your potions once more!

To the cowardly potion seller,

How have you deceived such an honest knight so? I asked for nothing but your strongest of potions, but you, in lieu of what I so pleaded for, gave me nothing but pasty water! The strength of that potion is naught to even defeat a fly, much less aid me in my righteous battles against the terrible foes that lie in wait! Did you not stop to think, dear potion master, that your deception could spill my life-blood across the hallowed ground? For when a knight goes into battle, they must prepare nothing but the greatest of strengths, and anything else should be certain doom!  

While I bested my foe with nothing but my own mortal power, I may not be as fortunate next time! I beseech you, do not perform such a foolish mistake again! I must implore you to understand that when I ask for your strongest potions, I speak not in riddles, but in the wholehearted truth!
