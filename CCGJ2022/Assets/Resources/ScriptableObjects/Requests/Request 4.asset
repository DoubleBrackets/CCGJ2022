  initialRequestText: 'Sweet potion seller,

    

    I reach for your tender
    helping hand with a matter of utmost, burning urgency. I, Jeremia, am one you
    may have seen before, running about the docks in this languid little town, sweat
    on my brow and the peculiar bounce of walk I have made my own over the years.
    Yes, you may have seen me before, but now, I am so ill that I would surely be
    unrecognizable to even those who love me with profound intimacy.

    

    My
    skin now glows with the dew of a heat unknown even to the devil in his sweltering
    dwelling. The very furnace of hell seems to have nestled itself into my core,
    and is intent on burning me from the inside out, body and soul holistically.

    

    And
    of course, because the world is generally cruel but to me even crueler, this
    affliction has come over me at the worst possible moment: for in two days time,
    I have a long awaited rendezvous with the most handsome man who has long been
    an object of my affections. Yet I fear in my current condition, the heat of my
    skin would burn him, and turn him away from me, and this coming meeting would
    meet a pitiful end unfit to the genuine nature and fervency of my feelings.

    

    To
    be fit for this long awaited moment which holds my youthful hope in its grasp,
    I ask for your expertise.

      you with immense gratitude, for your potion has quelled the unnatural heat

      Freshly renewed by the concoction you sent me, I flew to see the object of
      my affections with overwhelming health and hope of heart, and was met with
      a most favorable result indeed.  A million thanks to you, reputable potion

      to purify myself of this ailment for has been unresponsive to my earnest calls.
      Indeed it seems in quelling one heat the potion quelled another, for the fit
      of passion in both me and that whom I had come to be so fond for seems to have
      cooled just as well. For this I am much grieved, and while I would not wish
      for the heat of my skin to be returned at any cost, I nevertheless yearn for
      that lovely passion of attraction to return and bear its fruits to me.\r\n\r\n-Jeremia\r\n"
